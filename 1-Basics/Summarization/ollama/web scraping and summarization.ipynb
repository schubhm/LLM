He is an Oracle EBS guru, both for functional and technical. Over the last two years I have asked a lot of him.  I asked him to learn SOA and the Oracle Work and Asset Management software.  He stepped up and learned both swiftly.   He earned my respect and trust very quickly.  This enabled me to briefly describe projects to him, and let him take ownership to complete them.   Communication is the most important aspect on any offsite or offshore resources.  His ability to take a functional design and fill in the blanks and ask the right questions for any gaps was excellent.”\n",

      "“I have worked with Shubham for the last two years. His role on our project is as an Oracle eBusiness technical analyst. On our project, Shubham has worked in the Procure to Pay Modules, Inventory, GL, Projects Timekeeping and HR modules. Shubham knows the Oracle eBusiness technical framework and has wrote numerous interfaces as well as extensions and customizations. He is also able to communicate well with the functional team and able to translate functional designs to technical solutions. I would recommend him for an eBusiness technical role.”\n",

He is an Oracle EBS guru, both for functional and technical. Over the last two years I have asked a lot of him.  I asked him to learn SOA and the Oracle Work and Asset Management software.  He stepped up and learned both swiftly.   He earned my respect and trust very quickly.  This enabled me to briefly describe projects to him, and let him take ownership to complete them.   Communication is the most important aspect on any offsite or offshore resources.  His ability to take a functional design and fill in the blanks and ask the right questions for any gaps was excellent.”\n",
      "Mark Wood\n",
      "“I have worked with Shubham for the last two years. His role on our project is as an Oracle eBusiness technical analyst. On our project, Shubham has worked in the Procure to Pay Modules, Inventory, GL, Projects Timekeeping and HR modules. Shubham knows the Oracle eBusiness technical framework and has wrote numerous interfaces as well as extensions and customizations. He is also able to communicate well with the functional team and able to translate functional designs to technical solutions. I would recommend him for an eBusiness technical role.”\n",

He was my primary technical architect. His technical skills are top notch.  He is an Oracle EBS guru, both for functional and technical. Over the last two years I have asked a lot of him.  I asked him to learn SOA and the Oracle Work and Asset Management software.  He stepped up and learned both swiftly.   He earned my respect and trust very quickly.  This enabled me to briefly describe projects to him, and let him take ownership to complete them.   Communication is the most important aspect on any offsite or offshore resources.  His ability to take a functional design and fill in the blanks and ask the right questions for any gaps was excellent.”\\nMark Wood\\n“I have worked with Shubham for the last two years. His role on our project is as an Oracle eBusiness technical analyst. On our project, Shubham has worked in the Procure to Pay Modules, Inventory, GL, Projects Timekeeping and HR modules. Shubham knows the Oracle eBusiness technical framework and has wrote numerous interfaces as well as extensions and customizations. He is also able to communicate well with the functional team and able to translate functional designs to technical solutions.
