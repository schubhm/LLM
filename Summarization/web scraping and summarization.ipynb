He is an Oracle EBS guru, both for functional and technical. Over the last two years I have asked a lot of him.  I asked him to learn SOA and the Oracle Work and Asset Management software.  He stepped up and learned both swiftly.   He earned my respect and trust very quickly.  This enabled me to briefly describe projects to him, and let him take ownership to complete them.   Communication is the most important aspect on any offsite or offshore resources.  His ability to take a functional design and fill in the blanks and ask the right questions for any gaps was excellent.”\n",

      "“I have worked with Shubham for the last two years. His role on our project is as an Oracle eBusiness technical analyst. On our project, Shubham has worked in the Procure to Pay Modules, Inventory, GL, Projects Timekeeping and HR modules. Shubham knows the Oracle eBusiness technical framework and has wrote numerous interfaces as well as extensions and customizations. He is also able to communicate well with the functional team and able to translate functional designs to technical solutions. I would recommend him for an eBusiness technical role.”\n",

      "“I have had the pleasure of working with Shubham on a couple of projects over the past 5 years.  He was my primary technical architect. His technical skills are top notch.  He is an Oracle EBS guru, both for functional and technical. Over the last two years I have asked a lot of him.  I asked him to learn SOA and the Oracle Work and Asset Management software.  He stepped up and learned both swiftly.   He earned my respect and trust very quickly.  This enabled me to briefly describe projects to him, and let him take ownership to complete them.   Communication is the most important aspect on any offsite or offshore resources.  His ability to take a functional design and fill in the blanks and ask the right questions for any gaps was excellent.”\n",
      "Mark Wood\n",
      "“I have worked with Shubham for the last two years. His role on our project is as an Oracle eBusiness technical analyst. On our project, Shubham has worked in the Procure to Pay Modules, Inventory, GL, Projects Timekeeping and HR modules. Shubham knows the Oracle eBusiness technical framework and has wrote numerous interfaces as well as extensions and customizations. He is also able to communicate well with the functional team and able to translate functional designs to technical solutions. I would recommend him for an eBusiness technical role.”\n",

He was my primary technical architect. His technical skills are top notch.  He is an Oracle EBS guru, both for functional and technical. Over the last two years I have asked a lot of him.  I asked him to learn SOA and the Oracle Work and Asset Management software.  He stepped up and learned both swiftly.   He earned my respect and trust very quickly.  This enabled me to briefly describe projects to him, and let him take ownership to complete them.   Communication is the most important aspect on any offsite or offshore resources.  His ability to take a functional design and fill in the blanks and ask the right questions for any gaps was excellent.”\\nMark Wood\\n“I have worked with Shubham for the last two years. His role on our project is as an Oracle eBusiness technical analyst. On our project, Shubham has worked in the Procure to Pay Modules, Inventory, GL, Projects Timekeeping and HR modules. Shubham knows the Oracle eBusiness technical framework and has wrote numerous interfaces as well as extensions and customizations. He is also able to communicate well with the functional team and able to translate functional designs to technical solutions. I would recommend him for an eBusiness technical role.”\\n3 people have recommended Shubham\\nJoin now to view\\nView Shubham’s full profile\\nSee who you know in common\\nGet introduced\\nContact Shubham directly\\nJoin to view full profile\\nSign in\\nStay updated on your professional world\\nSign in\\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s\\nUser Agreement\\n,\\nPrivacy Policy\\n, and\\nCookie Policy\\n.\\nNew to LinkedIn?\\nJoin now\\nOther similar profiles\\nVishal Nigam\\nMississauga, ON\\nConnect\\nKulpreet Singh\\nVictoria, BC\\nConnect\\nKaran Kambo\\nGreater Toronto Area, Canada\\nConnect\\nLin Zhu\\nDenver Metropolitan Area\\nConnect\\nMonowar Chowdhury\\nGreater Toronto Area, Canada\\nConnect\\nEdouard Kopczuk, M.Eng.\\nMontreal, QC\\nConnect\\nUsman R.\\nUnited States\\nConnect\\nRahul Goel\\nGreater Toronto Area, Canada\\nConnect\\nMostafa Nasr\\nCanada\\nConnect\\nRohit Roy\\nOakville, ON\\nConnect\\nExplore collaborative articles\\nWe’re unlocking community knowledge in a new way.
