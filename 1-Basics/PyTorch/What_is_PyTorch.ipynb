    "## What is Pytorch?\n",
    "#### PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Meta's AI Research lab (formerly Facebook AI Research). It serves as a comprehensive machine learning library that provides flexible tools for building, training, and deploying neural networks across a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Torch - 2002, Code was written in LUA language, Torch was used to create Tensor based calculations on GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Meta married Python + Torch ====> PyTorch\n",
    "--------\n",
    "### Why Pytorch?\n",
    "- Python Compatibility\n",
    "- Dynamic Computation Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## RELEASE 0.1\n",
